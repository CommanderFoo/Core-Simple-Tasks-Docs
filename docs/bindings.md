# Bindings

**Simple Tasks** comes with a **Binding Set** so that players can open and close the task panel by pressing **T**. This can easily be changed by opening up the **Bindings Manager** from the **Window** menu.

In the **Binding Manager** panel, look for the binding set called **Reward Points - Simple Tasks**.

!!! warning "If you change the default binding to something other than **T**, then you will need to update the **key_string** settings property so the UI gets updated. See the Settings page."
