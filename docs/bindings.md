# Bindings

**Simple Tasks** comes with 2 bindings sets in the template.

## Default Bindings

The **Default Bindings** template is the Core default binding set that comes with new projects. This is included in the template in case a binding set doesn't already exist.

If you have your own binding set that has been customized, then you can delete this binding set from the **Hierarchy**.

It is important to be aware that if you have no default bindings in your **Hierarchy**, then in preview mode, your player will not be able to move. A default binding set comes with new projects, so this should not be be an issue. The reason for this, is because the content comes with a binding set with no default bindings set up.

!!! tip "You can have multiple binding sets in the **Hierarchy**."

## Custom Bindings

**Simple Tasks** comes with a **Binding Set** so that players can open and close the task panel by pressing **T**. This can easily be changed by opening up the **Bindings Manager** from the **Window** menu.

In the **Binding Manager** panel, look for the binding set called **Reward Points - Simple Tasks**.

!!! warning "If you change the default binding to something other than **T**, then you will need to update the **key_string** settings property so the UI gets updated. See the Settings page."
