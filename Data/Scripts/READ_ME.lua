Simple tasks is a reward points system that handles simple daily tasks. For example, login, driver a vehicle, kill a player. These are tasks that can be done quickly for those that just want to get some quick points for the day.

The system has some default tasks that come with it, as well as some examples of how to use the very simple API.

#####

Quick Start

- Drag "Reward Points - Simple Tasks" into the Hierarchy.
- Enter preview mode.
- Press T to open the task panel.

#####

IMPORTANT

It is important to be aware that if you have no default bindings in your **Hierarchy**, then in preview mode, your player will not be able to move. A default binding set comes with new projects, so this should not be be an issue.

The reason for this, is because this system comes with its own binding set, so Core will detect that and not refer to default bindings.

A default binding set template is included in the content that can be added to your **Hierarchy** if you prefer not to create one yourself.
